This project involves customizing the appearance and functionality of the **SignUp** button in an Android layout.

## Introduction

This is a part of an Android project where I worked on customizing the **SignUp** button inside a ConstraintLayout. The objective was to give the button a custom red background and adjust its appearance according to the layout requirements.

## What I Did

1. **Changed the background color of the button** to red.
2. **Adjusted padding and text style** to make the button look more prominent.
3. **Ensured text color is white** to provide good contrast against the red background.
4. **Removed unwanted background tint** which could interfere with the custom background color.
5. **Adjusted layout constraints** to properly position the button within the layout.
